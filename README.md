# Introduction to Computer Programming

## Overview
In short, I completed 30 Python programming questions covering various topics essential for beginners. This series includes subjects like:
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Lists
- Arithmetic Operations
- Functions
- And more!

This project serves as a resource for individuals to practice solving problems independently, using it as a paper to work through each exercise.

## Project Description
The **Capstone Project - Introduction to Computer Programming** serves as a culminating endeavor for learners embarking on their journey into computer programming using Python. This project encapsulates the fundamental concepts, principles, and skills acquired throughout the course, providing an opportunity for learners to apply their newfound knowledge in a practical and meaningful context.

In this capstone project, participants engage in hands-on coding exercises and problem-solving tasks that challenge them to utilize Python programming constructs such as:
- Variables
- Data Types
- Control Structures
- Functions
- Modules

Through the completion of various programming assignments and mini-projects, learners demonstrate their proficiency in writing clear, efficient, and well-documented Python code to solve real-world problems.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project include:
- Solidifying understanding of Python programming fundamentals.
- Developing problem-solving skills through practical exercises.
- Encouraging collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity.
- Preparing learners for future endeavors in computer science and software development.

## Acknowledgments
